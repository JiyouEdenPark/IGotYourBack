# IGotYourBack

A mechanical recreation of a childhood game â€“ where friends would write messages on your back and you had to focus on the feeling to get it right.

## Description
In this day and age where we are inundated by ubiquitous and instantaneous communication, we invite you to an experience where you communicate with others word by word, one letter at a time. As the user gauges how keenly they can decipher a tactile message, it symbolizes how even the smallest units of communication can be misunderstood and highlights the amount of focus needed to comprehend someone else's intentions. If you have faith and 'lean into' the experience, there's a higher chance you will fare better at getting the message right. We got your back!
